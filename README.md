# SpringHibernateTemplate
Spring + Hibernate base template

To run this template project setup the database by importing db_schema.sql. Run mysql on port 3306 then open the
"Application.java" file in your IDE and run it as a java program. SpringBoot should begin launching a tomcat container
and when it is finished, visit localhost:8080/api/listUsers to test out the application.
